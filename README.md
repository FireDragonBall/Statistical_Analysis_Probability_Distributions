Project Description
The game of Keno: keno is an ancient Chinese game that has become popular in recent
years. In one electronic version of this game, a player selects 20 numbers from the set of
numbers 1 through 100. The computer then randomly draws another set of 20 numbers
from the set 1 through 100, and the player is rewarded according to how many of his
selected numbers have been matched by the 20 numbers drawn by the computer.
Part 1
Let X be the number of matches between a player’s 20 selected numbers and the 20
numbers drawn by the computer. Then X may range from 0 (no match) to 20 (all match)
and follows a hyper-geometric probability distribution.
Complete all of the following steps (a – k) in R, using the data in the Part 1 worksheet in
Excel.
a. Construct a tabular probability distribution for X.
b. Construct a tabular cumulative probability distribution for X.
c. Create a graphical probability distribution for X.
d. Create a graphical cumulative probability distribution for X.
e. Calculate the theoretical expected value (mean), the theoretical variance, and the
theoretical standard deviation of X in the spaces provided for those quantities. Interpret
those values in your Word report
f. Generate 1000 random values according to the standard uniform probability
distribution.
g. Use the available tabular cumulative distribution of part (b) to randomly generate 1000
values of X according to the described Hyper-geometric probability distribution.
h. Calculate the experimental (simulated) expected value (mean), the experimental
variance, and the experimental standard deviation of X in the spaces provided for those
quantities.
i. Calculate the experimental means successively after n = 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 simulations.
j. For the same values of n, calculate the Theoretical mean of X. Use the fixed value of the
theoretical mean calculated in part (e). 
k. Create a line plot of the Experimental mean values versus the number of simulations
(n). Add the horizontal line plot displaying the theoretical mean of X. Run several
simulations of the successive experimental means. Interpret your observation in the
context of the Law of Large Numbers (as the number of simulations become larger, the
experimental values of the means approach to their theoretical value).
Part 2
Complete all of the following steps (a – h) in R, using the data in the Part 2 worksheet in
Excel.
a. A normal population is given in column E of the worksheet. Calculate the mean, the
variance, and the standard deviation of this population.
b. Construct a Relative Frequency Histogram of the given population. Discuss the shape of
the distribution in your report.
c. Using the random sampling method in R, randomly draw 30 samples with each sample
consisting of 30 measurements from this population.
d. For each sample, calculate the sample mean, the sample variance, and the sample
standard deviation in the designated cells.
e. Calculate the average of 30 sample means, the average of 30 sample variances, and the
average of 30 sample standard deviations.
f. Compare your results of part (e) above with those obtained for the population in part
(a). Discuss similarities and contrasts in the context of the Central Limit Theorem.
g. Construct a relative frequency histogram for the 30 sample means obtained from part
(e) above. Comment on the shape of the distribution of the sample means.
h. Summarize your findings of this experiment in your report.
